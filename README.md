# posts-app ðŸš§ðŸ‘·ðŸšœ
WIP fullstack application made as a way of practicing technologies learned on one of my internships

## Objective
A fullstack CRUD application based on posts and comments. Each post can have an unlimited number of comments and can be upvoted/downvoted as wished. The comments, on the other hand, will only hold a "liked" state, without any dislike mechanism.

Backend is made on [Spring](https://spring.io/) with [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/), while the Frontend is built with [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) using the [MaterialUI](https://material-ui.com) library for those pretty components. I used [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) for the database.
